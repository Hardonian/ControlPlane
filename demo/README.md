# Demo Mode

This directory holds deterministic demo inputs and outputs generated by the demo scripts.

- `demo-input.json` is the immutable input template.
- `input.json`, `report.json`, and `evidence.json` are regenerated by `pnpm run demo:reset` and `pnpm run demo:start`.

Demo mode never calls external services; it uses the local runner adapter with a fixed timestamp.
