# Governance

ControlPlane contracts and tooling are maintained by the core maintainers of this repository.

## Decision-Making

- Minor changes are approved through standard pull request review.
- Significant changes (contract schema changes, compatibility policy updates, release process changes) should be proposed in GitHub Discussions before implementation.
- Maintainers seek consensus; when consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final call based on ecosystem impact.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Enforcing compatibility and release policies
- Responding to security reports
- Maintaining documentation accuracy

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who consistently provide high-quality contributions can be invited to become maintainers. If you are interested, open a discussion with your contribution history and areas of focus.
