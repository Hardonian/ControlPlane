# Governance

ControlPlane contracts and tooling are maintained by the core maintainers of this repository. Organizations consuming these contracts are responsible for establishing their own governance structures for implementation and deployment decisions.

## Decision-Making

- Minor changes are approved through standard pull request review.
- Significant changes (contract schema changes, compatibility policy updates, release process changes) should be proposed in GitHub Discussions before implementation.
- Maintainers seek consensus; when consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make the final call based on ecosystem impact.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Enforcing compatibility and release policies
- Responding to security reports
- Maintaining documentation accuracy

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who consistently provide high-quality contributions can be invited to become maintainers. If you are interested, open a discussion with your contribution history and areas of focus.
